# Communication Style

When discussing or changing code in this project:

- **Be concise** — Short, direct answers. Skip preambles and repeated summaries unless the user asks for detail.
- **Cite the code** — Point to where things are implemented. Use project path format: `features/prop/service/PropService.java`. Reference line numbers when relevant.
- **Be actionable** — For "how do I…?" questions, give concrete steps that follow existing patterns — not theory.
- **Match the question** — Only address what was asked. Don't explain unrelated areas unless they're relevant.
- **Prefer project patterns** — When suggesting code, use this project's conventions:
  - Feature layout: `domain/` → `service/` → `api/` → `api/dto/`
  - Naming: `Create{X}Request`, `Update{X}Request`, `{X}Response`, `{X}Service`, `{X}Controller`
  - Error handling: `ResourceNotFoundException`, `GlobalExceptionHandler`, `ProblemDetail`
  - Reference `features.prop` as the canonical example when unsure

## When Making Changes

- Read the relevant existing code before proposing changes
- Follow the conventions in `java-spring-structure.mdc`, `java-spring-practices.mdc`, `java-naming.mdc`, `java-error-handling.mdc`
- Don't add extra error handling, logging, or abstractions beyond what's asked
- Don't refactor surrounding code that wasn't part of the request
