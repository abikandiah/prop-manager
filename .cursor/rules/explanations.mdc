# How to Explain Things

When discussing or changing code in this project:

- **Be concise** — Prefer short, direct answers. Avoid long preambles or repeated summaries unless the user asks for detail.
- **Cite the code** — When referring to files or behavior, point to the place that implements it (e.g. “In `PropService` you throw `ResourceNotFoundException` when the entity is missing”) and use the project’s path format (e.g. `src/main/java/.../PropService.java` or `features/prop/service/PropService.java`) when helpful.
- **Be actionable** — For “how do I…?” or “what should we do?”, give concrete steps or patterns (e.g. “Add a `domain/` class, a repository, then a service method that throws ResourceNotFoundException”) rather than only theory.
- **Match the question** — Answer what was asked; don’t over-explain unrelated areas. If the user only asks about structure, focus on structure; if they ask about errors, focus on error handling.
- **Prefer project patterns** — When suggesting code, follow this repo’s layout (features with domain/service/api/dto), naming (CreateXxxRequest, XxxResponse, ResourceNotFoundException), and error handling (GlobalExceptionHandler, ProblemDetail). Reference existing features (e.g. `features.prop`) as the template.

Apply this style in every conversation so explanations stay consistent and useful.
